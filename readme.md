To reproduce, download http://www.cancerrxgene.org/gdsc1000/GDSC1000_WebResources/Data/preprocessed/Cell_line_RMA_proc_basalExp.txt.zip and decompress it in data folder

You can find the progeny pathway activity estimate with up-to-date version of the decoupleR package in results/GDSC_progeny_activities.csv (estimated with the ULM method, top 100 model weight)

You can find the TF activity estimate with up-to-date version of the decoupleR package in results/GDSC_TF_activities.csv (estimated with the ULM method, collectrI regulons, minimum 5 targets/TF)

You can find the mapping between GDSC cell IDs and cell line names in results/cell_name_mapping.csv

See https://saezlab.github.io/decoupleR/articles/pw_bk.html for more info on progeny/TF pathway activity
